  - CONTRIBUTING guide is brief but covers essentials (env setup, branch flow, code style, testing)
  - Assumed dev→uat→prod strategy from task context; branch strategy aligns with Phase 0 → production workflow
  - Kept tone warm and human-facing, not hype-y; focused on enabling contributors

- **Status:** Issue #1 closed. PR #47 (dev→prod) created. Ready for prod merge.
- **Cross-team:** CONTRIBUTING, README, and issue templates available to all agents for onboarding and issue management.

## README Refresh (Current)

**Date:** 2026-03-16  
**Task:** Update README.md to reflect current project state  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Changes Made
- **Project Description:** Clearer intro emphasizing multiplayer board games, real-time play, and team-built
- **Games Section:** Added dedicated section listing Checkers (2-player), Risk (multi-player), and teased Backgammon
- **Tech Stack:** Expanded table with full details (Client: TS/PixiJS v8/Vite/React; Server: TS/Colyseus/Node/Express; Infrastructure: Docker/Azure/PostgreSQL; Testing: Vitest + Playwright)
- **Features:** Refined bullet points to highlight Colyseus, PixiJS, lobby, plugin architecture, testing
- **The Squad:** Added new section with team roster including all 10 members + Copilot, with status indicators and tone-appropriate framing
- **Removed:** Duplicate "Squad Team" section; consolidated into one team section with context

### Validation
- ✅ Build passes (npm run build) — all workspaces compile
- ✅ No broken links or stale references
- ✅ Tone: warm, accessible, not hype-y
- ✅ Accurate game inventory (Checkers + Risk live; Backgammon in design)
- ✅ Matches tech stack with Colyseus, PixiJS v8, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Azure

### Key Decisions
- **Games section honesty:** Listed only live games (Checkers, Risk); teased Backgammon as "coming soon" rather than claiming all three are playable
- **Squad framing:** Presented as collaborative team with Copilot as "Coding Agent" — friendly tone, not corporate
- **Kept existing content:** Dev setup, DB reference, project structure, plugin pattern, deployment — no removal of useful info
- **Infrastructure layer added:** Acknowledged Docker, Azure, PostgreSQL as part of tech stack (was missing before)

## Galaxy Wars — New Project (2026-03-17)

**Project:** Galaxy Wars — modern multiplayer space strategy game inspired by TradeWars (BBS classic)
**Stack:** Colyseus (multiplayer backend), PixiJS (2D rendering), TypeScript
**User:** dkirby-ms
**Prior art:** Builds on Colyseus/PixiJS framework from Primal Grid and Playgrid

### Core Design Pillars
1. **Turn limits** — each player gets a fixed number of turns/actions per day, creating strategic tension and preventing no-lifers from dominating
2. **Alliances/Federations** — organic player coalitions that form over time, central to the social experience

### Game Features
- Galaxy exploration (sectors, warps, navigation)
- Outpost and mining station construction
- Planet settlement and colonization
- Trading between empires (economy/market system)
- Fleet building (ships for attack and defense)
- Empire growth and federation diplomacy
