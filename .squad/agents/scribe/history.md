## 2026-03-15: Logged Session Resilience Sprint

**Event:** Orchestration complete — 3-agent parallel session (Pemulis, Gately, Steeply)

**Work Logged:**
- 3 orchestration logs (pemulis, gately, steeply)
- 1 session log (session-resilience overview)
- 4 decision inbox files merged → decisions.md (no duplicates)
- Cross-agent history updates appended
- Git commit staged

**Decisions Merged:**
1. Pemulis: Presence-backed cleanup architecture
2. Gately: sessionStorage lifecycle + startup reconnect
3. Steeply: Two-layer test strategy (concrete + contracts)

**Context Propagated:**
- Pemulis history: Gately's client parallel work + Steeply's test contracts
- Gately history: Pemulis's server seams + Steeply's test contracts
- Steeply history: Pemulis/Gately seam availability + conversion guidance

**Status:** ✅ Memory synced. Ready for commit.


## Galaxy Wars — New Project (2026-03-17)

**Project:** Galaxy Wars — modern multiplayer space strategy game inspired by TradeWars (BBS classic)
**Stack:** Colyseus (multiplayer backend), PixiJS (2D rendering), TypeScript
**User:** dkirby-ms
**Prior art:** Builds on Colyseus/PixiJS framework from Primal Grid and Playgrid

### Core Design Pillars
1. **Turn limits** — each player gets a fixed number of turns/actions per day, creating strategic tension and preventing no-lifers from dominating
2. **Alliances/Federations** — organic player coalitions that form over time, central to the social experience

### Game Features
- Galaxy exploration (sectors, warps, navigation)
- Outpost and mining station construction
- Planet settlement and colonization
- Trading between empires (economy/market system)
- Fleet building (ships for attack and defense)
- Empire growth and federation diplomacy
